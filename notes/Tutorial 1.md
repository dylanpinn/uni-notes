# Tutorial 1

1. Discus how real-time enterprise systems can be harnessed to support the current market behaviour of "Online-connectivity, real-time response and in-context performance."
A real-time system has been described as one which "controls an environment by receiving data, processing them, and returning the results sufficiently quickly to affect the environment at that time."

 
Another definition: Real-time enterprise systems are systems where "â€¦transactions are executed by straight through processing, information is captured at the point of origin through reality online; and databases are updated continuously, shared and mined in ways that makes their content more meaningful and more actionable."

 
The framework for harnessing Real-time Enterprise, "Sense-Analyse-Response" is in a way supporting this behaviour of "Online connectivity, real-time response and in-context performance."

 
There is an ever-increasing expectation of speed and levels of service, particularly when it comes to businesses, especially so where supplier-client relationships are concerned. Every company deals with data that is located in different places, is accessed in different ways, and is used for different purposes. The success of a business is often gauged by the efficiency of a business to sense and respond to their customer needs - both relevant and timely.

 
Real-time enterprise systems provide that online-connectivity within the supply chain. The real-time information that these systems afford provides a cutting edge to companies in developing and marketing products and services that are relevant (in-context) and timely. They are ahead of the curve because they have better information than do their competitors.

 
Context analysis is a method to analyse the environment, both internal and external, in which a business operates. This is an important aspect of business planning to analyse the environment in order to develop a strategic plan of action for the business - so as to "add value" to their customers. Real-time enterprise systems offer the agility to sense, analyse and respond by developing and implementing practical and innovative solutions to enhance business operational effectiveness.

 
2. Discuss the framework of "Sense-Analyse-Response" in respect to the case of "Telematics Service Delivery" (Architecting the Real-Time Enterprise, pp 24-28).
The business strategy of the enterprise determines what needs to be sensed, what kinds of the analysis is needed and what the responses need to be while the business processes, information and IT systems support the collection and analysis of information and in the execution of the response.

 
"Sense" component enables the enterprise to be informed of all external and internal information that is relevant.

"Analyse" component helps analyse the information, identify patterns, forecast and predict likely impacts and consequences.

"Respond" component determines the best possible response based on the analysis of the relevant information and executes the determined response.

 
In Telematics:

Real Time Data Capture- Vehicles transmit data in the form of data packets, every few seconds. The Telematics platform must be able to handle the large volume of data coming from thousands of vehicles.

 
Real Time Data Analysis- Telematics platforms are required to analyse data in real time in order to provide insights.

 
Real Time Content Integration- The Telematics platform must enable integration with enterprise systems and concerned 3rd parties to improve overall organisational responsiveness.

 
Real time enterprise systems have to address important attributes of architecture like scalability, high availability and reliability as to remain responsive and updated.

 
3. Based on the case of "Retail Promotion Optimisation" (Architecting the Real-Time Enterprise, pp 29-32), discuss the benefits that can be realised from the real-time enterprise solutions.
To assess what benefits they can realise from the real-time Enterprise solutions, we should have a look at what should be term as their success factors:

 
As retailers are looking for ways to reduce cost, the ability to provide lower cost of ownership provided by the solution would be an important factor. Analytics provided by the solution is the USP and hence its efficiency would be a key factor. Retailers should be able to see increase in sales because of data provided by analytics, reports and optimum promotions as suggested by Promotion Optimisation Engine. The benefit should be clearly reflected in the dollar value in terms of cost savings and increase in sales because of better promotion management across channels and geographies.

 
Another key aspect for the success of this solution is its adaptability. Some kind of solutions may already exist in retailers today. The ease with which retailers and business users could switch from legacy systems to this solution would become important.

 
The IT management on the other hand would look for the ease of integration of the solution with their existing infrastructure without much of the effort and investment.

 
So, the benefits would be:

Business agility, flexibility, scalability, faster time to market, access to best in class analytical ability, scope for customisation and lower cost of ownership are some the key benefits that retailers should be able to realise from this solution.

 
4. Distinguish between a business function and a business process. Describe how a business process cuts across functional lines in an organisation. How might a manager organiser his or her staff in terms of business processes rather than functional departments? What benefits would there be with this type of organisation? What challenges would it pose?
A business function is a business "activity", such as sales order processing, production scheduling, cash-flow management, and recruiting personnel. A business process is a collection of activities that takes one or more kinds of input and creates an output that is of value to the customer.

 
A business process occurs when a series of activities are performed in more than one functional are. Making and selling a product to a customer is a process that involves sales, production, and accounting activities. The people who work in each activity must work together to make the sale go smoothly - taking the order, scheduling production, shipping the product, recording data about production and sales and the ultimate collection of the customer's payment.

 
Today, business managers try to think it terms of business processes that integrate the functional areas, thus promoting efficiency and competitiveness. An important aspect of this integration is the need to share information between functional areas and with business partners. ERP software provides this capability by means of a single common database.

 
The better a company can integrate the activities of each functional area, the more successful it will be in today's highly competitive environment. Integration also contributes to improvements in communication and workflow. Each area's information system depends on data from other functional areas.
