# Tutorial 11

1. Discuss what are microservices and containers and why it is useful to run microservices in containers.

    * Microservices

        * Type of software architecture
        * Applications are broken down into a series of functions and each singular function is performed by small, self-contained units working together.
        * As they are independent of each other they can be written in any language and implement any storage solution.
        * Architecture is more agile and significantly faster
        * As they are responsible for completing smaller, lighter tasks they can complete them much faster, which allows for more frequent reassessment and adaptation.

    * Containers

        * Light weight virtual machine
        * Typically isolated from the host operating system and each other.
        * Usually consists of an application that contains all of the artefacts required to run.

    * Running microservices in containers

        * Enable to scale quickly owing to a simpler deployment model
        * Aren't tied to the software on the host system, so can run different versions of the same storage or programming language.


2. Discuss the use of RFID technology in logistics and sales.

    * Tracking items through supply chain
    * RFID device can be attached to products
    * Small package (or tag) made up of a microprocessor and an antenna
    * RFID readers can determine location of an item with an RFID tag.
    * Advantages

        * Does not require line-of-sight connection
        * Can withstand most environment stresses.
