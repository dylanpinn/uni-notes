# Lecture 2

## Lecture Overview

* Applications development

    * Planning
    * System development lifecycle
    * Database design

* Usability
 
## Applications Development

* The steps involved in building a web application shouldn't be any different than those involved in any other type of application.
* Planning

    * Who is the most important person in the planning process?

        * Often project managers/analysts/designers/programmers all think it is them
        * But it really the client

            * Experts in their own business
            * Being able to determine their requirements is often very difficult.



* System Development Life Cycle

    * The most common method used to be the waterfall method

        * Very rigid with steps completed sequentially and once completed never re-visited.
        * Assumed all requirements are specified fully and correctly right from the start.

    * Agile methodology

        * Introduced in 2001 and promotes rapid, iterative and flexible development.
        * Breaks the proposed application down into "builds" or "delivery cycles" which are vertically complete.
        * The builds are then fully developed and delivered to the client

            * Client sees working software quicker
            * Easier to make changes

        * Common misconception that is means "no rules" and is a way to allow programmers to get out of producing documentation so that they can just write code.

            * All of the waterfall steps are often still used within each build
            * Requires training and practice to be used successfully.



* Eliciting requirements is often very difficult

    * Client may not be sure what they want
    * Client may not be able to articulate what they want
    * Client may have a poor understanding of the capabilities and/or limitations of technology
    * Client may leave out information they consider obvious

* Identify stakeholders

    * The proprieties and vision for the project may be different for different users within an organisation and the analyst needs to create a shared vision which is acceptable to everyone.
    * May be useful to find a project champion who is invested in the success of the project.

* Interviews

    * Determine what information you are seeking
    * Consider props - forms, reports, screen shots
    * Avoid long interviews as enthusiasm drops
    * Distribute findings and get everyone's confirmation

* Questionnaires

    * Best for limited and specific information from many stakeholders
    * Response rate may be variable and result in unusable data

* Review existing forms, procedures and reports

    * Must be done carefully as it may result in automating current system

* Observation

    * Most useful as it shows actual system interactions
    * Can be time consuming, and observed staff may be self conscious and not act naturally.

* Once requirements are finalised, it's a good time to prioritise them

    * Helps avoid "scope creep"
    * The client needs to be involved in this and it may require some negotiation

* A common approach is the MoSCoW method

    * M - MUST have
    * S - SHOULD have it at all possible
    * C - COULD have if it doesn't affect anything else
    * W - Probably WON'T have but WOULD like to have in the future.

* Change management

    * A formal policy should be established to ensure a consistent approach to changes

        * Detailed description of the proposed change
        * Impact of implementing and not implementing the change
        * Estimation of time and cost of implementation

    * Allows an informed decision to be made regarding whether or not to implement the change.

* Proposal evaluation

    * Should the project go ahead?
    * Is a web application the best solution?

        * If the application will only ever by accessed from a single location maybe a client-server application is a better option.


* If the client wants a solution to a common business problem maybe someone has already developed a good solution

    * Buy off the shelf may be an option
    * Buy off the shelf and then customise may be an option

* Prototyping

    * Mock-ups of a proposed system to allow client to experience look and feel of system
    * Drawbacks

        * Client may think that they are looking at a finished system and don't understand why they cannot use it.
        * Developers may spend a lot of time developing prototypes then discard them

    * May be necessary to scope prototypes in the same way we scope a system

        * May not be necessary to scope the whole system - possibly just the most used functions.


* Prototypes can take may forms:

    * Low fidelity

        * Usually rough and paper based
        * Allows rapid feed back on concepts, colours, workflow, etc.

    * Medium fidelity

        * Usually produced using a software based tool
        * Usually able to demonstrate behaviour such as interaction and navigation

    * High fidelity

        * Usually a high-tech representation of the application
        * Can provide partial to complete functionality
        * Usually provides an almost complete UI/UX


* Prototyping

    * Choice of method depends on factors such as client requirements, budget and available tools
    * May choose more than one method and fidelity to give client a more "real" experience
    * Ensure client understands the use and purpose of prototypes
    * Don't overreach and prototype something you can't deliver
    * Don't be a perfectionist

        * Should be good enough to give stakeholders a common understanding of proposed applications

    * Lot of other planning tools that we won't cover

        * User stories
        * Activity diagrams
        * UML


* Database

    * Crucial piece of the planning puzzle
    * Need to be mindful of application purpose

        * Don't go too big or too small

    * Client needs to be involved again
    * Determine what is important to the business

        * Who and what do we need to store information about?
        * How and when does it need to be accessed?
        * The who and what generally translate into entities
        * The how and when may enable establishment of relationships between entities

    * Database type is not very important at this stage
    * Attributes

        * Characteristics of entities

    * How and when data is accessed is important

        * Store client name as a single attribute or two separate attributes
        * Store addresses as a single attribute or split into component parts

    * Redundancy

        * Do we store customer name in order table?
        * Do we store order total?


* Database Normalisation

    * 1NF - identify PK and repeating groups
    * 2NF - remove partial dependencies

        * Ensure non key attributes are identified by all parts of a composite key.

    * 3NF - remove transitive dependencies

        * Ensure all non key attributes are identified by key attributes


* Database

    * Think about what the PK should be

        * If there is no obvious choice let the DBMS generate it
        * Generally don't need users to remember PKs

    * It is not necessary to tell a PK which table it belongs to

        * C001 for clients

            * Limits the number of possible clients
            * Makes it difficult for system to generate key



* Database Foreign Keys
* Database testing

    * Documentation is just as important for the database as for other aspects of the system

        * Create a data dictionary which describes the entities, the relationships between them and the attributes.


## Usability

* Definition

    * The ease of use and learnability of a human-made object

* A commonly used them, but often the most poorly implemented aspect of any software application - particularly web applications.
### Navigation

* Should be clear and intuitive

    * If the user cannot find what they want easily, you have already failed

* Shouldn't depend on JavaScript for Flash
* Should be usable on mobile devices.
* What's in

    * Simple. No sub menus
    * Fixed navbars
    * Vertical sliding navigation (good for mobile devices)

* What's out

    * Navigation in a non-standard location

        * Keep it on top of the left

    * Too many items in the menu
    * Menu items too long
    * Menu items in the word order - most commonly used items should be on the left or right
    * Using graphics for menu items rather than plain text.

### Familiarity

* User would like to use software - without having to think about it
* Microsoft is very good at this
### Consistency

* Could be considered as the other side of the familiarity coin
* Difficult to make your cutting edge web site seem familiar to users

    * Ensure all pages within the site are consistent with each other
    * The longer they use the site, the more familiar it will feel.

* Follow conventions established by well known web sites

    * Users may be familiar with Amazon or eBay where the  "buy now" buttons are generally in the same location

### Error Prevention

* Almost impossible to make any product, application or web site 100% user proof.
* Users will always be able to perform some function or peculiar sequence of functions that was never tested and produces unexpected results.
* The developers job is to ensure recognition or errors and provide easy recovery
* Don't use jargon
* Don't apportion blame
* Allow the user to recover from an error or at least back out of their action
### Feedback

* The user needs to know WHEN a processed has been completed
* The user needs to know if a process completed SUCCESSFULLY
* Might be useful to break long processes up into several steps and let the user know where they are in the sequence.
### Visual Clarity

* Arranging and displaying content in the best way for user consumption
* Present information in a natural and logical manner to enable the most efficient and likely path through information
* Users should be able to start using your application or web site quickly, with little or no need of prior learning.
### Flexibility & Efficiency

* Flexibility is often the natural enemy of consistency & familiarity aspects
* It's not a welcome feature of some applications/web sites
* What sort of web site would it be useful for?

    * E-learning

        * Users can move ahead if they have prior knowledge of a topic


* Website should be designed with enough flexibility to display usefully on different browsers

    * The old practice of developing parallel sites for different devices should be avoided
