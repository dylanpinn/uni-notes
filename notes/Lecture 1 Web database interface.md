# Lecture 1: Web database interface

## Lecture Overview

1. Welcome
2. Academic Staff
3. Unit Outline and Objectives
4. Software Requirements
5. Unit Content
6. Web database concepts and technologies
7. GIT
## Learning Outcomes

* explain the need and importance for system developers to have skills in this area of IT applications;
* describe and compare the key basic technologies which underlie the development of web-database applications;
* evaluate and access the key technological issues confronting developers building applications of this type;
* implement the key features of programming languages which are commonly used for developing web-database application;
* analyse, design, develop and implement a web-database application using a well-known programming language;
* evaluate and critique proposed web-database solutions to a business problem.
## Web database concepts

* Why are web interfaced databases useful for businesses?

    * Most businesses maintain a database of clients, products, etc.
    * It makes sense to display this content on a website

        * If the database is well designed, clients can easily search for products.
        * Price alterations can be immediately updated on the website.
        * Sales via the web site can be immediately reflected in inventory levels.
        * The website can be personalised for clients when the log in.


* Content Management Systems (CMS) / blogs etc. are heavily used and popular examples of web database applications.
## Web database technologies

* We are currently in the third generation of dynamic web pages

    * Static Generation

        * static, mainly text, some images, required "experts" to maintain them.

    * Dynamic - Generation 1

        * Technologies such as JavaScript and VBScript allowed dynamic "client side" functionality.
        * Different browsers tended to implement the scripts differently.

    * Dynamic - Generation 2

        * First generation of server-side scripting
        * CGI (Common Gateway Interface - 1993) scripts which executed on the web server

            * Often using Cookies to overcome statelessness of the web.

        * Problems

            * Required a programming language which has good communication facilities such as C, C++, Perl or Python.
            * Scalability - CGI spawned a separate process on the web server for each request it received.


    * Dynamic - Generation 3

        * Microsoft released ASP (Active Server Pages) in 1996 (became .NET in 2002)
        * Several competitors were created:

            * ColdFusion - 1996
            * Sun released Java Servlets (1997) and then JSP (1999) and then JEE (1999).

        * PHP became publicly available in 1998

            * Server-side scripting language.



## Uses for server-side technologies

* Two most common uses

    * Retrieving data from a data store, in response to a query and inserting it into a web page.
    * Handling POST form input and writing it to storage, e.g. database, file system or retrieving data from storage and displaying in a web page.

## Web database technologies

* The web server passes control to another processes (PHP engine), creates the HTML and passes it back to the web server, which sends it back to the browser.
* Benefits

    * Universal browser readability
    * User platform independence
    * Protection (hiding) of source code

* Drawbacks

    * Increased network load (multiple trips to the server)
    * Increased server load
    * Dates, times, currency symbols, etc. are taken from the web server.

## Lecture Summary

* Why we need web interfaced databases
* The history of web interfaced databases
* Some of the most popular technologies and programming/scripting languages involved with web interfaced databases
* An overview of GIT and why we use it
